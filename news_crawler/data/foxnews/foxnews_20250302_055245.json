President JD Vance, conditions for a peace agreement and more with Putin in an exclusive 'Special Report' interview.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not apologize for the heated exchange with [President Donald Trump](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/politics/conservatives-rally-around-trump-after-meeting-zelenskyy-goes-off-rails>) in the Oval Office, but told Fox News in an exclusive interview he is confident their relationship can be salvaged.\nZelenskyy's meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance erupted into a shouting match at the White House on Friday that was seen worldwide. The Ukrainian president traveled to the United States to meet with Trump after the commander-in-chief said a peace negotiation to end the war between Ukraine and Russia is in its final stages. \n\"Mr. President, do you think your relationship with Donald Trump — President Trump — after today can be salvaged?\" Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier asked Zelenskyy.\n\"Yes, of course, because it's relations more than two presidents. It's the historical relations, strong relations between our people, and that's why I always began… to thank your people from our people,\" Zelenskyy said during an exclusive interview Friday on \"[Special Report](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/shows/special-report>).\"\n\"Of course, thankful to the president, and, of course, to Congress, but first of all, to your people. Your people helped save our people… we wanted very much to have all these strong relations, and where it counted, we will have it.\"\nZelenskyy said he was \"not sure that we did something bad\" when asked about the heated exchange but conceded the dustup was \"bad for both sides.\"\n\"I just want to be honest, and I just want our partners to understand the situation correctly, and I want to understand everything correctly. That's about us not to lose our friendship,\" he later said.\n[**TRUMP SAYS ZELENSKYY CAN ‘COME BACK WHEN HE IS READY FOR PEACE’ AFTER FIERY WHITE HOUSE EXCHANGE**](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-zelenskyy-can-come-back-when-he-ready-peace-after-fiery-white-house-exchange>)\nDuring [Zelenskyy's visit to the White House](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-back-zelenskyy-following-trump-vance-oval-office-spat>), Vance said a path to securing peace between Russia and Ukraine was through the United States engaging in diplomacy. Zelenskyy then tried to engage in a line of questioning about Russia's moves since 2014 and attempts at diplomacy.\n\"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance told Zelenskyy. \"Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems.

Don't tell us what we're going to feel.\" \nThe president also accused Zelenskyy of \"playing cards.\"\n\"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III.

I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out, but you don't have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position, but you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing, I'll be honest.

What is the reaction? It's not about me. The reaction is that, where is our friendship between Ukraine and the United States? This is [the] feeling,\" he said, repeating calls for being \"correct\" in characterizing the war. \n\"It's not funny or fairytale. This is real life. That's what I said, and when you said it a lot of times to my big friends, we've been here today in our dialogue, and then they again begin to repeat the same things… it's not good way between partners, good partners and friends.\"\n[**CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP**](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/download>)\nWhen Baier asked whether Zelenskyy thought the confrontation was pre-planned, the Ukrainian leader stressed he did not know. Instead, he said it \"was just a really tough situation because we've been very open, very direct.\"\nThe Trump administration was also working to ink an agreement with Ukraine that would allow the United States access to Ukraine’s minerals in exchange for support the United States has offered the nation since war broke out in 2022, as part of the peace deal. \nThe Oval Office exchange led to a canceled press conference, a minerals deal off the table and Trump asking the Ukrainian president to leave, a White House official previously confirmed to Fox News Digital. \n _Fox News Digital's Emma Colton, Andrew Mark Miller and Diana Stancy contributed to this report._\nMadeline Coggins is a Digital Production Assistant on the Fox News flash team with Fox News Digital.\n## Related Topics\n  * [Media](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/media>)\n  * [Fox News Flash](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/topic/fox-news-flash>)\n  * [Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine>)\n  * [Special Report](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/shows/special-report>)\n  * [Donald Trump](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump>)\n  * [Foreign Policy](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy>)\n  * [Trump's First 100 Days](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential/trump-transition>)\n  * [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy>)\n\n\n![Fox News First](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_MORNING-HEADLINES-532x120.png)\n### Fox News First\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.\nArrives Weekdays\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News [Privacy Policy](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/privacy-policy>) and [Terms of Use](https://www.foxnews.com/media/<https:/www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use>), and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

House](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/video/6369453179112>)\nFox News contributors Karl Rove and Dan Hoffman join ‘America Reports’ to analyze the heated exchange between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n**FIRST ON FOX** : President Donald Trump's refusal to grant a key demand made by [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine>) precipitated their explosive confrontation during a live press event at the White House.\nA stunned world watched Friday as [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house>) and Trump reprimanded Zelenskyy in full view of reporters, with cameras rolling. From the moment the Oval Office event started, the dynamic between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart was noticeably different from the two other press events Trump held with world leaders this week. \nAccording to sources close to Zelenskyy, tempers had flared even before the event began. The Ukrainian president was apparently presented with a minerals for security agreement by the Trump administration prior to the press event, but the deal included no security guarantees to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion. \nZelenskyy had warned repeatedly ahead of his trip to Washington, D.C., that, in order to reach a mineral agreement, Kyiv needed these security assurances. Even so, he angered Trump and Vance by rejecting the deal, the source said. \n**TUNE IN: BRET BAIER INTERVIEWS ZELENSKYY ON 'SPECIAL REPORT,' 6 PM ET ON FOX NEWS**\n![Trump and Zelenskyy](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/1200/675/trumpz.png?ve=1&tl=1)\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\nSubsequently, just minutes after reporters asked their first questions, an aggressive spat unfolded between the heads of state that left officials behind the scenes scrambling to understand how the situation fell apart so quickly. \n\"We cannot just sign an … agreement without any substantial guarantees,\" one Ukrainian defense advisor told Fox News Digital. \"It’s not going to work. It’s just going to reward the aggressor.\"\nZelenskyy’s refusal to sign a deal apparently contributed to the ire of Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\nThe [White House](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house>) has not confirmed the discussions that occurred ahead of the press event. \nThe heated spat unfolded after Trump suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014 and again in 2022 because Trump wasn’t in office, blaming Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who sat in the Oval Office at the corresponding times.\n[**ZELENSKYY BREAKS SILENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER FIERY OVAL OFFICE EXCHANGE WITH TRUMP: 'THANK YOU AMERICA'**](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/politics/zelenskyy-breaks-silence-social-media-after-fiery-oval-office-exchange-trump-thank-you-america>)\n![Zelenskyy](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/1200/675/zleaving2.png?ve=1&tl=1)\nZelenskyy and Trump openly clashed at the White House Feb. 28, 2025, at a meeting where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine's mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"Yeah, that's exactly right,\" Vance said. \nZelenskyy pointed out that Russia never stopped attacking Ukraine between 2014 and 2022, four years of which included Trump’s first term. \n\"Nobody stopped him you know,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that Putin repeatedly violated bilateral agreements. \n[**ZELENSKYY LEAVES WHITE HOUSE AFTER BEING ‘KICKED OUT’ FOLLOWING HEATED MEETING**](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/video/6369453130112>)\n![Zelenskyy leaves the White House](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/1200/675/zleaving.png?ve=1&tl=1)\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the White House Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Getty Images)\n\"What kind of diplomacy are you … speaking about? What do you mean?\" Zelenskyy asked at the White House after Trump said he was \"aligned\" with both Russia and Ukraine.\nVance interjected, saying, \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\n[**CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP**](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink>)\nZelenskyy has repeatedly pointed out that while the U.S. under the Biden administration approved substantial aid to Kyiv, it is Ukrainian soldiers fighting on the front lines to stop Russian aggression that poses a threat to all of Europe and could embolden adversaries like China, North Korea and Iran, which run counter to U.S. interests. \n\"You have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future,\" he argued. \nAn angered Trump said, \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel.\"\nCaitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.\nSponsored\nSponsored Stories You May Like\n[](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.outbrain.com/what-is/default/en>)\n## Related Topics\n  * [Trump's First 100 Days](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential/trump-transition>)\n  * [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy>)\n  * [Donald Trump](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump>)\n  * [JD Vance](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance>)\n  * [Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine>)\n  * [Russia](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia>)\n\n\n![Antisemitism Exposed](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/antisemitism-exposed-nl.jpg)\n### Antisemitism Exposed\nFox News' Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.\"\nArrives Weekly\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News [Privacy Policy](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/privacy-policy>) and [Terms of Use](https://www.foxnews.com/world/<https:/www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use>), and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
