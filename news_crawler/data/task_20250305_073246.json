    "content": "# President Trump pushes ahead with promise as tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China go into effect\n\n\n\nThe Claman Countdown panelists Kenny Polcari and Simeon Hyman analyze how the markets will respond to a tariff on Canada and Mexico.\n\nPresidentDonald Trump'snew tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico took effect at midnight Tuesday morning, increasing the taxes that U.S. importers will pay on certain goods when they enter the country.\n\nEffective Tuesday, U.S. imports from China, the third-largest U.S. trading partner, will be subject to a new 10% tariff on top of the initial 10% tariff he imposed on Chinese goods last month.\n\nTariffs on imported goodsfrom Canada and Mexico – America's two largest bilateral trading partners, according to Census Bureau data – are also set to rise, with 25% tariffs levied on all imports from the two countries. The tariffs include a carve-out for a lower 10% tariff on Canadian oil imports.\n\nPresident Trump was asked on Monday whether there was room left for any room left for Canada or Mexico to make a deal to avoid tariffs and he replied, \"No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.\"\n\nWARREN BUFFETT SAYS TARIFFS ARE AN ECONOMIC 'ACT OF WAR': 'TOOTH FAIRY DOESN'T PAY 'EM'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports took effect Tuesday, as did an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nShortly after taking office in January, Trump announced he would impose tariffs on the three countries and cited the flows of illegal fentanyl shipments across the Mexican and Canadian borders, as well as precursor chemicals for fentanyl shipped from China. He cited authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nWhile theChina tariffswere implemented on schedule, the president delayed the Canada and Mexico tariffs for a month after the two countries announced border security measures.\n\n\"Just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10%, so it's 10 plus 10. And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that's a very important thing to say,\" Trump said during Monday's press conference.\n\nWHO GETS STUCK WITH THE BILL FOR TARIFFS ON IMPORTED CANADIAN OIL?\n\nU.S. agricultural products will face retaliatory tariffs imposed by America's trading partners.(Ben Brewer/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nU.S. trading partners have already signaled they will retaliate through their own tariffs on American exports, as well as potential non-tariff trade barriers that would be aimed at U.S. firms.\n\nCanada announced that it will impose a 25% tariff on a wide variety of American exports, including machinery, auto parts, apparel products, alcohol and tobacco, sports equipment, plastic products, construction materials, lumber, agricultural products, appliances, furniture, chemicals and more.\n\nIt also plans additional tariffs on other U.S.-made products that are expected to includecars, trucks, buses, electric vehicles (EVs), recreational vehicles, steel and aluminum products, fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.\n\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY WITH BIGGEST MONTHLY DROP IN NEARLY 4 YEARS\n\nThe U.S. auto industry is expected to face retaliatory tariffs for auto parts and potentially finished vehicles.(Photographer: Emily Elconin/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nMexico's governmentsignaled in February that it is planning retaliatory tariffs it would implement if Trump imposed tariffs on Mexico, though it didn't specify those measures at the time. A report by Reuters citing sources familiar with the matter suggested the potential tariffs could range from 5% to 20% on U.S. pork, cheese, produce, and manufactured steel and aluminum.\n\nChina retaliated against the initial tariffs by imposing 15% tariffs onU.S. energy exports, including coal, natural gas and petroleum; as well as 10% tariffs on manufactured goods, including trucks and agricultural machinery, a Brookings Institution analysis noted.\n\nThe newly imposed tariffs are expected to elicit more retaliation from China, as the AP reported that the Chinese government is eyeing tariffs on U.S.agricultural exports and food productsas targets.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAnanalysis by the Tax Foundationfound that the tariffs imposed on imports from China would reduce long-run GDP by 0.1%, while the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods would deal a bigger blow to economic output, reducing GDP by 0.3%. Those figures are before accounting for retaliation by those countries against American products.\n\nThe Tax Foundation's analysis noted that the U.S. imported $292 billion of non-energy products from Canada in 2024, as well as $120 billion in energy products. Imports from Mexico totaled $504 billion last year, while those from China totaled $430 billion plus additional imports shipped using the \"de minimis\" loophole.",

    "content": "# Vance reveals where things 'broke apart' with Zelenskyy blowup in 'Hannity' exclusive\n\n\n\nVice President JD Vance opens up about the heated meeting involving President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on 'Hannity.'\n\nVice President JD Vance gave his perspective on the widely-seen spat last week at the White House between PresidentsDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying it all started when his answer to a journalist’s question set the Ukrainian leader \"off.\"\n\n\"I do think that there was just a certain sense of — there was a lack of respect. There was a certain sense of entitlement,\" Vance said Monday in an interview on \"Hannity,\" his first since the dustup.\n\nDuring the meeting in the Oval Office, the former Ohio senator explained the importance ofengaging in diplomacyto end Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war when Zelenskyy asked if he could follow up.\n\nPUTIN ‘DOESN’T WANT PEACE,' EU CHIEF DIPLOMAT WARNS AHEAD OF TRUMP, ZELENSKYY DEAL\n\nHe described Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, previous failed peace agreements and a 2019 ceasefire that was violated by the Kremlin.\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" Zelenskyy asked incredulously.\n\n\"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded. \"Ithink it’s disrespectfulfor you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media…You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\"\n\nHe then chided the Ukrainian leader for being ungrateful for American aid and questioned if he'd even said thank you during their meeting. Zelenskyy has thanked the United States for its support multiple times on his X account and during a December 2022 address to Congress.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a briefing with press on July 8, 2023 in Lviv, Ukraine.(Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)\n\nVance told Fox News host Sean Hannity Monday that he attempted to defuse the situation, claiming he tried to have the conversation in private.\n\n\"The president was like, nope, actually, I don't want to have it in private anymore. I want to havethis actual conversationin public for the American people to see,\" the vice president said.\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy engaged in a tense and unprecedented back and forth where the president claimed the Ukrainian leader was \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\nThe rare earth minerals deal that the two world leaders were supposed to sign fell through after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platformthat his counterpart could come back \"when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves from his vehicle as he arrives at the Trump International Golf Club, Monday, Feb. 17, 2025, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\n\"The president has set a very clear goal for his administration. He wants the killing to stop. And I think that it's very important thatPresident Zelenskyyand of course, President Putin, too, they've both got to come to the negotiating table. And that's ultimately where things broke apart,\" Vance explained.\n\n\"I really don't care what President Zelenskyy says about me or anybody else. But he showed a clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process that President Trump has said is the policy of the American people and of their president.\"\n\nWORLD LEADERS BACK ZELENSKYY FOLLOWING TRUMP, VANCE OVAL OFFICE SPAT\n\n\"This thing cannot go on forever,\" he continued. \"There aren't enough Ukrainian lives, there isn't enough American money, and there isn't enough ammunition to fund this thing indefinitely. The only realistic pathway to bring this thing to a settlement is President Trump's pathway. We encourage both President Zelensky and President Putin to follow that path.\"\n\nA senior Trump administrationofficial told Fox NewsMonday afternoon that it was temporarily suspending all U.S. military aid to Ukraine following the spat until the president determines the Ukrainians show a commitment to good-faith peace negotiations.\n\nAshley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.",
